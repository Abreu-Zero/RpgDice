# rpg-dice-swift


For a long time, you know, because of this quarantine, me and some friends are trying to play RPG via chat - mostly using Whatsapp and online dice rollers.
But there is this weird friend that always had the worst results ever and the other one that is always getting criticals and stuff.

Seeing our struggle, I decided to take a look at the [D&D 5th Edition API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) 
and create a small iOS app that could help instant message RPG players all around the world

Why?
-----

Well, I thought that would be nice to have a handy helper with stuff like: 
items and equipment description, classes and monsters... 

besides, of course, a die roller that could save the date and time of the said roll, maybe a list with the last ones rolled as well 

that all to be shared via messages and help the dungeon master to narrate the game.

Requirements and Specifications:
--------------------------------

* App should roll die from D4 to D20
* App should save the date and time of the roll, as the last rolls in a list
* App could display a small manual for equipment
* App could display spells
* App could display classes and races

How?
-----

You can just clone the project on Xcode and build and run at your device

Update
------

Oct 2020 - They are always updating the results at the API part, so I decided to include a few UITests to keep checking if the app is working
